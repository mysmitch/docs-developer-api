# Testers

Testers are `MySmitch` [users](user.md) that a developer can [manually add via the developer portal](../developer-portal/get-started.md#4-invite-a-tester-for-your-app) , tester accounts can only be accessed by use of [TEST API Keys](../app/api-keys.md#test-api-keys).

> Testers will have to manually accept your invite \(sent to them via email\) and will remain in `pending` state, before you can access their account and device details

Each [App](../app/app.md) can have a maximum of `10` testers, you are free to add and delete testers whenever you like, and you can re-send tester invites up-to three times in a day.
