# Introduction

Currently the API **can't** interact with `MySmitch` users directly. We plan to have an Integrations Store, where users can search for your App and install them directly, after which your App can interact with the users and their devices.  
For now, please consider adding [testers](user-tester.md) to your [App](../app/app.md).

To learn more about how User Data is modeled in the API please refer [User Data Structure](user-data-structure.md)
