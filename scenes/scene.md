# Introduction

Scenes are a collection of devices belonging to the same home and set to a desired state.  
When a scene is triggered \(or turned `ON`\), all the devices present in the scene change to the state \(color, brightness etc\) as described in the scene.

## How to create a scene?

Currently, scenes can only be created from the `MySmitch` Mobile App

## How to Trigger a scene?

Please refer [Tutorial Trigger a Scene](https://github.com/mysmitch/api-docs/tree/d872805d5300971840c2f2c7ab96d7b3172df4a1/scenes/tutorials/2-trigger-a-scene.md)

## Can a Triggered Scene be cancelled?

No. Currently there is no way of cancelling a scene that has been triggered. However, if the devices mentioned in the scene are offline, the change in device state won't happen.
