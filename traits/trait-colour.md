# Colour

The `colour` trait is currently present only for [light device](../devices/device-light.md) and is used to change the `RGB` \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model)\) values.  
Each colour channel can have values ranging from `0` to `255` \(you can think of them as intensity values for the RGB LED's, 0 corresponds to the lowest value and 255 being the highest value\)
