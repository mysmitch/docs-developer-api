# Temperature

The `temperature` trait is currently present only for [light device](../devices/device-light.md) and is used to change the color temperature \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature)\) value for the device.

The range of values are integers from `2700` \(lowest temperature level\) to `6500` \(highest temperature level\)
